On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

+ This week I started to think about our project in detail. I have downloaded android studio and met with xml files.
+ Achieved to add music files to the raw file without any problems. Also created the music page layout and written the codes to play and pause the musics. Although first constraints in the layouts was a bit problamatic, in the end I understand the logic of xml layouts.
+ Me and my friend Deniz Semih Özal tried to link music, settings and theme page together with intent class. However, in some cases problems occured so we solve the problem with saherd preferences(with the geting datas.)

+ This week was quit challenging, because we had some problem with github. We couldn't push our work firstly and also after pushed it, we had some problems about merging our works to each other as well.However, close to end of the week we understand the github.
+ I added the information button to the layouts which simply give brief information about that current level.

For achievements page I had to create a graph contains the user information. Therefore, i needed a library because android studio doesn't have it in first place. I tried some graphs such as graphview and its various verisons but all of them were problematic or I couldn't achieve to work them but spent quit a lot of time to theme. Finally graphlib library worked and i created the graph and AchievementsPage layout as well.
