On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

This week we did the first division of labor after the group meeting, and everyone took a different role in the project. I took the task of making the First Page. By researching on the Internet first I learned how to use android studio and how to design in android studio. Then I found some backgrounds and customized them and made button designs. Finally, I designed First Page.

This week we decided to design the game after the group meeting. I first learned how to design a game map by watching videos and downloaded the necessary program for this. After downloading the program, I designed the level 3 and wrote the codes. Then I designed the level 4, level 5, level 6, and level 7 and changed the codes according to the level content. After writing the codes of the levels, I searched the internet and learned how to save the data to the system. Using the information I learned from the Internet I used the SharedPreferences class and added new codes to the First page and level pages.

This week I added the star counts feature to improve the functionality of the levels. The user will gain stars depending on the number of moves. The number of stars won by the user will be saved in the system and this data will be sent to the achievements page. Besides I designed and coded the splashScreen page, which is the landing page of our project Because the code is a bit irregular and inefficient we also used the class hierarchy with Alperen, and we made the code more regular and efficient.
