On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

This week we did the first division of labor after the group meeting, and everyone took a different role in the project. I took the task of making the First Page. By researching on the Internet first I learned how to use android studio and how to design in android studio. Then I found some backgrounds and customized them and made button designs. Finally, I designed First Page.

This week we decided to design the game after the group meeting. I first learned how to design a game map by watching videos and downloaded the necessary program for this. After downloading the program, I designed the level 3 and wrote the codes. Then I designed the level 4, level 5, level 6, and level 7 and changed the codes according to the level content. After writing the codes of the levels, I searched the internet and learned how to save the data to the system. Using the information I learned from the Internet I used the SharedPreferences class and added new codes to the First page and level pages.
