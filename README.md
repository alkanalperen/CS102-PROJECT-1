## Project Description
   _FunAlgo is an application that allows people to learn algorithm logic with an entertaining way. Users can play games requiring basic structure of algorithms and also, they can draw different sorts of shapes on creative mode by using different algorithm steps. Users can see their achievements for each level. Moreover, FunAlgo includes different type of musics and themes that can be attractive for our main target audience. FunAlgo may be useful for adults but our target audience is children. FunAlgo is a mobile application and it is coded on Android._

#### What Remains To Be Done
+ We are planning to add Creative Mode as well, now we are trying to add a pencil animation
which follows the line simultaneously. 
+ Level9 Page will be ready hopefully as well.
+ Achievements Page is nearly done, now we are planning to getting data from the levels and store them
in Achievements Page.
+ Code efficiency and design are our main concern for now and we are tying to create more efficient, neat code.
+ Comments will be added.
